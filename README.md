# ProductMarketingPage
A simple project from a course meant to show what I could do using vanilla JS, I did not come up with the desing, and the ideas of implementantion are not my own, I just followed a set of tasks for how the page to work and compared results with the teacher, where I found something useful I changed my code for his so I could reflect on better code later
